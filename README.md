1. Top 5 cities with highest spends.
2. Highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type.
3. Transaction details for each card type when it reaches a cumulative of 10,00,000 total spends.
4. Total gold card spendings in the city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type.
5. City, highest_expense_type, lowest_expense_type.
6. Percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type.
7. which card and expense type combination saw highest month over month growth in Jan-2014.
8. during weekends which city has highest total spend to total no of transcations ratio.
9. which city took least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction in that city.
